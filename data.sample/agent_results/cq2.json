  "answer": "The query results show that the gene labeled as \"gene Y\" was not explicitly mentioned in the data returned. However, cell lines have been engineered to overexpress specific genes, as listed below:\n\n1. **CHO-DG44** cell line has been engineered to overexpress the **antibody product gene**, with productivity values ranging from Medium to High.\n2. **CHO-K1** cell line has likewise been engineered to overexpress the **antibody product gene**, showing a range of productivity from Low to High.\n3. **HEK293** cell line has been engineered to overexpress the **IgG** gene, with productivity categories from Medium to Very High.\n\nTo find cell lines engineered to overexpress a specific gene labeled \"Y,\" a more targeted query with the exact gene of interest specified would be necessary.",
