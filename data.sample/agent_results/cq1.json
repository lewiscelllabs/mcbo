  "answer": "The cells reach peak recombinant protein productivity under the culture conditions with a temperature of 37.0\u00b0C, pH of 7.1, and dissolved oxygen level of 60.0%. This optimal condition was observed in a Fed-Batch Culture Process run (run_DEMO002_RUN_C) involving cell line HEK293, which resulted in VeryHigh productivity.\n\nAdditionally, another run (run_DEMO001_RUN_A) under the same conditions, but with a slightly lower pH of 7.0 and dissolved oxygen level of 40.0%, also achieved High productivity. However, no other runs showed peak productivity at these specific values of temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen.\n\nThese results suggest that while there is some variability, consistent optimal conditions for achieving high recombinant protein productivity appear to be a temperature of around 37\u00b0C, with both pH and dissolved oxygen levels between 60% and 50%, though higher dissolved oxygen levels (around or above 60%) correlate more closely with peak productivity.",
