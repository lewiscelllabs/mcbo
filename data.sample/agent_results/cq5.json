  "answer": "In the comparison between Fed-batch and Perfusion culture processes in cell line K, only one gene, HSP90, showed significant differential expression, with a downregulation in Fed-batch compared to Perfusion culture. However, no enriched pathways were identified based on this gene in the KEGG pathway analysis. This suggests that while HSP90 may play a differential role in these culture conditions for cell line K, it does not directly map to a clear pathway difference based on available KEGG pathways.",
