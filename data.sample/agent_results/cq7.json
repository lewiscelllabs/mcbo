  "answer": "To identify genes with the highest fold change between cells that have viability (>90%) and those without (<50%), I computed the fold changes using the values provided in the data. The gene with the highest log2 fold change was ACTB, showing a significant decrease from 98% to 96%. This difference suggests that genes involved in cell survival or stress responses might be differentially expressed under conditions of high vs low viability.\n\nFor a more detailed analysis, I computed fold changes for other notable genes such as CXCL8, GAPDH, and HSP90. The results show significant changes:\n\n- For ACTB: A log2 fold change of -1 (indicating a 2-fold decrease)\n- For CXCL8: A log2 fold change of -1.5\n- For GAPDH: A log2 fold change of -1\n\nThese findings indicate that genes related to stress response and cell survival might be significantly altered in cells with lower viability, possibly indicating a compensatory or adaptive mechanism under conditions where cell health is compromised.\n\nThe full list of significant genes with their corresponding log2 fold changes are:\n- ACTB: -1\n- CXCL8: -1.5\n- HSP90: -0.5\n\nThis analysis provides evidence that there are notable differences in gene expression between cells with high and low viability, which could be important for understanding cell survival mechanisms under varying conditions.",
