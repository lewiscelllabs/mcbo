The MCBO is formally represented using constructs from the OWL 2 ontology language and aligned with best practices in biomedical ontology engineering. Our design approach prioritizes practical utility while maintaining semantic rigor, creating a foundation that supports both automated reasoning and human-readable domain modeling. The ontology models key biological and process-driven entities relevant to mammalian cell cultivation experimentation. At the core is the abstract concept CellCultureProcess, from which specific operational modalities inherit: BatchCultureProcess (closed-system culture), FedBatchCultureProcess (batch with discrete nutrient additions), PerfusionCultureProcess (continuous nutrient feed with waste removal), and ChemostatCultureProcess (perfusion with constant dilution rate). Each subclass inherits properties from its parent while introducing specialized attributes. The ontology employs standard OWL/RDFS constructs as foundational building blocks. owl:Class defines the core domain concepts (e.g., CellCultureProcess, BatchCultureProcess, PerfusionCultureProcess), while rdfs:subClassOf captures hierarchical relationships (e.g., FedBatchCultureProcess is a subclass of BatchCultureProcess, which in turn is a subclass of CellCultureProcess). owl:ObjectProperty defines relationships between concepts such as hasNutrientConcentration, hasCultureConditions, or inCulturePhase, and owl:DatatypeProperty captures literal data attributes like hasCollectionDay, hasConcentrationValue, and hasViableCellDensity. The framework supports rdf:type declarations for individuals and allows optional owl:Restriction constraints for more precise domain rules.
Bioprocess Variables and Measurements are represented through datatype properties such as hasViableCellDensity, hasViabilityPercentage, haspH, hasTemperature, hasDissolvedOxygen, and hasTiterValue, attaching standardized numeric values and units (hasConcentrationValue, hasConcentrationUnit) to measurement classes (e.g., CellViabilityMeasurement, ProductivityMeasurement, QualityMeasurement, GeneExpressionMeasurement, which subclass the OBO ‘measurement datum’ class, obo:IAO_0000109), enabling standardized annotation of experimental observations. The ontology adheres to modular reuse principles, aligning with established ontologies including the Systems Biology Ontology (SBO)4, Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI)5, and Units of Measurement Ontology (UO) where applicable. Each concept is formally linked through semantic relationships and annotated with human-readable labels and definitions to promote interoperability with other biological and biomedical knowledge graphs.This semantic backbone provides a foundation for expressive metadata annotation, reproducible modeling, and ontology-driven form generation, while supporting automated reasoning, consistent data integration, and downstream schema validation.
